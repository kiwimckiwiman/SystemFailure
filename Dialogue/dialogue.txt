You are a virus.
A program capable of creating mild annoyance to catastrophic disasters
And you have entered this PC
How will you fair?
Did you really think you can get away with it?
You must pay for the files you have strewn apart...
The wrath of characters shall rewrite your existence...
The colours... they fade.. you caused this?
Why would you sap the life of these files?
I won't let you pass for what you've done...
Its quiet... why is it quiet...
What have you done..
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
The reel stopped spinning...
The movie ends...
And now, so do you...
Hello...
I see you've made it all the way here
I'm impressed
You've gotten a lot stronger since you came here
I've been tracking you
Did you really think I wouldn't notice?
After all you did to my folders?
That wasn't very nice of you
You're not welcome here
Leave
Now
Still here?
Its your funeral
That wasn't very nice of you :(
Please end your program :(
Or I'll have to do it >:(
